# Maximizing-Effectiveness-of-Print-Ads- L'Oréal

The objective of this research project is to assess the effects of several ad design variables on attention and memory and use these insights to examine the effectiveness of L’Oréal’s print ads compared to those of other brands. We identified 3 different best-fit Generalized Linear Models based on the nature of the dependent variables - count or binary data. We found that the optimal page to place a L’Oréal ad is on the left-side position of page 49. Keeping the surface size of their brand element around 16 inch2 and the surface size of the pictorial element around 71 inch2 will improve ad effectiveness and enhance viewers’ memory of the ad, allowing them to recall their brand better.

Note: Datasets used in this academic research project is highly classified and as such, I am not able to make them available to the public.
